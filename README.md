This app was built as part of my course work for Suncoast Developers Guild. The key objectives for this project were:

-To pull the API from coinmarketcap.com and present the current price of the top 100 coins
-Using state in React
-Render data from an API request in React
-Using setInterval to repeat
-Using React the following lifecycle methods: componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount
-Using React Component subclasses

Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
