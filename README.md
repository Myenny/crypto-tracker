This app was built as part of my course work for Suncoast Developers Guild. The key objectives for this project were to pull the API from coinmarketcap.com and present the current price of the top 100 coins.

Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
